Snowball stemming library collection for Javascript
===================================================

What is Stemming?
-----------------

Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common "stem" - for
example, the English stemmer maps *connection*, *connections*, *connective*,
*connected*, and *connecting* to *connect*.  So a searching for *connected*
would also find documents which only have the other forms.

This stem form is often a word itself, but this is not always the case as this
is not a requirement for text search systems, which are the intended field of
use.  We also aim to conflate words with the same meaning, rather than all
words with a common linguistic root (so *awe* and *awful* don't have the same
stem), and over-stemming is more problematic than under-stemming so we tend not
to stem in cases that are hard to resolve.  If you want to always reduce words
to a root form and/or get a root form which is itself a word then Snowball's
stemming algorithms likely aren't the right answer.


How to use library
------------------

You can use each stemming modules from Javascript code - e.g to use them
with node:

.. code-block:: javascript

    const stemmer = require('base-stemmer.js');
    const english_stemmer = require('english-stemmer.js');

    var stemmer = new EnglishStemmer();
    alert(stemmer.stemWord("testing"));

You'll need to bundle ``base-stemmer.js`` and whichever languages you want
stemmers for (e.g. ``english-stemmer.js`` for English).
