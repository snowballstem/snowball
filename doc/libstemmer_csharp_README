What is Stemming?
-----------------

Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common "stem" - for
example, the English stemmer maps *connection*, *connections*, *connective*,
*connected*, and *connecting* to *connect*.  So a searching for *connected*
would also find documents which only have the other forms.

This stem form is often a word itself, but this is not always the case as this
is not a requirement for text search systems, which are the intended field of
use.  We also aim to conflate words with the same meaning, rather than all
words with a common linguistic root (so *awe* and *awful* don't have the same
stem), and over-stemming is more problematic than under-stemming so we tend not
to stem in cases that are hard to resolve.  If you want to always reduce words
to a root form and/or get a root form which is itself a word then Snowball's
stemming algorithms likely aren't the right answer.


Compiling the library
=====================

To build a library::

mcs -target:library -out:snowballstemmer.dll csharp/Snowball/*.cs csharp/Snowball/Algorithms/*cs

And to build the example program using that library::

mcs -target:exe -out:stemwords.exe -r:snowballstemmer.dll csharp/Stemwords/Program.cs

Using the library
=================

There is currently no formal documentation on the use of the C# version
of the library. Additionally, its interface is not guaranteed to be
stable.
