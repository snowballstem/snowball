Snowball stemming library for PHP
=================================

This is an automatically-generated pure PHP implementation of the Snowball
stemming algorithms.

The generated code is compatible with PHP 8.3 and later.  The `mbstring`
extension is required.

It would be possible to extend support to older PHP (back to 7.4) if there's
demand for it.  Please contact us if this would be useful to you.

This library is intended for situations where the convenience of a pure PHP
implementation is more important than performance.  If performance
matters we recommend using the C implementation via bindings instead,
(for example, using https://github.com/amaccis/php-stemmer).

How to use library
------------------

You can stem a word from PHP as follows:

.. code-block:: php

    require 'base-stemmer.php';
    require 'english-stemmer.php';
    $stemmer = new SnowballEnglishStemmer;
    $word = 'compiled';
    $stem = $stemmer->stemWord($word);
    printf("%s => %s\n", $word, $stem );

	// prints "compiled => compil"
