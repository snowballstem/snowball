LAW Modifications

* snowball/compiler/driver.c:

Added new defaults for a more parameterised generation of java code.

java.lang.StringBuilder is the new String building class instead of
java.util.StringBuffer. This avoids the synchronised methods of the
StringBuffer class and also allows the user to specify a personal developed
StringBuilder compatible class (e.g., it.unimi.dsi.lang.MutableString).

The package, base-class and Among class are parameterised so the defaults
may be overridden if needed. (The needed changes were added to header.h)

* snowball/compiler/generator_java.c
The Among arrays in the generated stemmers are declared static final. The
lookup is thus much faster w.r.t. the previous version.
Package, base-class and Among classes will be those provided on the CLI.

* header.c
Add strategy_class char*

* Java packages:

  - Add java_law package folders for MG4J libraries
