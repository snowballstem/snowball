        // Notice that c₂ isn't actually used - the most obvious explanation

        // Elsewhere the paper defines V... as meaning "the stem starts with
        // a vowel" and K... as meaning "the stem starts with a consonant".

        // odd as the first letter must be either a vowel or a consonant, so
        // that really just means "ends cᵢcⱼ".  However, nowhere in the paper
        // uses or defines a notation such as ...X, which may explain this
        // seemingly redundant way of specifying this.
        //
        // The conditions elsewhere on prefix removal (e.g. V...) are clearly
        // on the stem left after the prefix is removed.  None of the other
        // rules for suffix removal have conditions on the stem, but for
        // consistency with the prefix rules we might expect that the cᵢcⱼ
        // test is on what's left *after* removing the "i" suffix.
        //
        // However, studying Indonesian wordlists and discussion with a native
        // speaker leads us to conclude that the purpose of this check is to
        // protect words of foreign origin (e.g. "televisi", "organisasi",
        // "komunikasi") from stemming, and the common feature of these is
        // that the word ends "-si", so we conclude that the condition here
        // should be read as "word does not end -si", and this is what we
        // have implemented.
